## Generate `PPComLib.sdk`

- Open `PPComLib.xcodeproj`

- Select `Framework` scheme, then press `Command + B` to build it. Your desktop will generated two files when build finished, one is named `PPComLib.framework`, another is `PPComLib.bundle`.

- Drag `PPComLib.framework` and `PPComLib.bundle` to your project, and it should work well now. Here is [another article](https://github.com/PPMESSAGE/ppbook/blob/master/part2/ppcom/ios-sdk.md) to help you integrate with `PPCom iOS SDK` to your project.

## How to make your own `Framework`, please reference this article:
